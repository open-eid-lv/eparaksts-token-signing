Chrome Token Signing 1.0.2 release notes
--------------------------------------------
Changes compared to ver 1.0.0

- Added support for pkcs#11 on Windows
	- Added support for negative scenarios with pkcs#11 backend in Windows (wrong pin, no pin, retries, etc.)
	- Windows native host can be configured to load a specific pkcs#11 module by sending {pkcs11ModulePath:"full-path-to-pkcs11-module"} e.g. {pkcs11ModulePath:"C:\opensc-pkcs11.dll"} from extension. In order to use this {forcePkcs11:true} must also be sent.
	- The native host looks for pkcs#11 module with name opensc-pkcs11.dll when forcePkcs11:true is sent without pkcs11ModulePath
- Removed openssl dependency on Windows build
- Fixed CAPI support for Windows
	- Reversing CAPI signature
	- Fixed error checking when using CAPI
	- Fixed Latvian ID-card signing with CAPI (in addition to PKCS#11)
